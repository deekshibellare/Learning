# Why swift is awesome?

I am may be biased here towards Swift because I make living out it. But I definitely believe Swift is powerful and beautiful.

* Swift ensures type-safety, which makes sure that a lot of bugs are caught at compile time itself.  Effective use of 'guard', 'if let' and optional chaining helps developers to write safe code.

* It is concise and readable. An unnecessary redundant code is eliminated. Type inference makes code shorter. Custom function arguments help to understand the context of the function call easier. 
Example:  array.insert(newElement, at: currentIndex)

* It is open source and has a great community backing it. 

* Comes with powerful pattern matching. 

* Enums are powerful. Extensions, Generics are useful and widely used features.

* It encourages protocol-oriented programming. Supports functional programming as well. 

* Ready to use functions and higher order functions like map, filter, flatmap 

* Swift is the modern programming language with syntax similar to Kotlin or C# which makes it open and easy to other developers outside iOS community.
